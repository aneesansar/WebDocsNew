            While we don't produce these items ourselves, we only choose the best partners to do so on our behalf. This benefits you because we're able to offer lower prices by utilizing a larger production mechanism and benefits us as we can better focus on our mission while still giving you something to enjoy. It is important for us that our products are climate-neutral and made only with high-quality ressources. These of course have to align with out objectives. This means that we take care to only use suppliers who respect our conditions: No forests should be harmed (this is a concern especially with cotton), the transport distance should be kept to a minimum, any carbon emissions created by this are to be offset by investing in other projects and every employee along the way (as well as farmers) should be receiving a fair wage. By setting these conditions we're able to ensure that what you receive is a good item produced in an environmentally friendly and morally correct way.

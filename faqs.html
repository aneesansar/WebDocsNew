            <h2 class="h2heading-left">What is your mission?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">We aim to reduce the waste found in our forests. The more waste there is, the worse
                trees and other plants can
                grow. You can also read about the impact on our <a href="Aboutus.html">About page</a>. Healthy forests
                are necessary to combat
                climate change, therfore we dedicated our resources to help them.</p>
            <h2 class="h2heading-left">Why did you create this company?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">We want to help combat climate change as much as possible. We asked ourselves what the
                best way to do this is
                and came to the conclusion that not enough is done to make sure these important CO2 absorbers stay
                healthy.
                Trees are useful to improve the overall air quality which is why
                we decided to make sure they can do their job.</p>
            <h2 class="h2heading-left">How can I help?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Please look at our "<a href="Donateus.html">Support Us</a>" pages. There you can
                donate, buy some merchandise or get advice on how to take
                action yourself.</p>
            <h2 class="h2heading-left">Where are you located?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">We have multiple locations throughout Germany. You can find these on our <a
                    href="Contactus.html">contact page</a>.</p>
            <h2 class="h2heading-left">Are you planning to go international?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Although we'd like to expand our operation to more countries in the future, there
                currently are no specific
                plans to do so. Currently we're sadly too small to do this in an efficient way but we'll update you as
                soon as
                there are plans.</p>
            <h2 class="h2heading-left">Is it really that important to keep the forests clean?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Inorganic waste doesn't decompose easily which can lead to plant roots not being able
                to penetrate the surface
                or rain water not reaching
                the soil leading to too few minerals getting to the trees. Given enough waste, this will hinder the
                growth of
                trees and will eventually
                kill the forest. Furthermore it can lead to contaminated water sources.</p>
                <h2 class="h2heading-left">Are you operating carbon neutral?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Yes! In fact, we're offsetting more CO2 than we emit. Additionally, our cause helps to lower the CO2
                concentration by creating healthier forests.</p>
                <h2 class="h2heading-left">Are you able to help out with our project X?</h2>
            <p class="text-left">If you have a project that might fit our mission, please <a>get in touch with us.</a> Then we can discuss the
                details and see how we can help.</p>

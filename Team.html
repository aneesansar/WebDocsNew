            I am Tom Brose the original founder of the forest sweepers. I always loved going out in the woods. As a child I played for hours in the forest without it ever getting boring. So, it was a big shock as I first realized how bad some people treat nature. As I first saw that huge pile of garbage in the forest just behind my old home, I know I had to do something. I founded the forest sweepers to make nature as beautiful as it originally was.
